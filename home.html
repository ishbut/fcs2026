		The 9th International Conference on Frontiers in Cyber Security (FCS 2026) will be jointly organized by City University of Macau and Hubei University of Technology. It will be held in Macau, from 3 August to 5 August, 2026. Cyber security is being paid more and more attention by industry and academia. New cyber security technologies are emerging. Many universities and institutions have set up research centers or schools for cyber security. Both government and enterprises strongly support teaching and research in cyber security. However, how to conduct research and education on cyber security is inexperienced and how to run a center for cyber security is also worth exploring since it involves many departments. The FCS conference provides a good platform for researchers and practitioners to exchange the latest research results in cyber security. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS), which is indexed by EI.

		We will continue to promote “<i>Practical Security</i>” as the theme for ProvSec 2023. The event convened researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new practical cyber security technologies, including their applications and integration with IT systems in various industrial sectors.
