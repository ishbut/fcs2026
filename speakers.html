					<strong>Title</strong>
				                <p>Toward Data Security on AI Systems</p>
					<strong>Abstract</strong>
					<p>AI has unlocked incredible potential to analyze, interpret, and act on the increasingly vast amounts of data. With the swift rise of AI adoption in corporate and government settings, data security and privacy are top concerns.
 
This talk will give an introduction to data security on AI systems, especially from the perspective of the threats and attack surfaces in the data-driven lifecycle for machine learning systems. The threats are widespread at all stages of AI systems, boosting the research on various types of attacks and security/privacy-enhancing technologies with different focuses on the training, Inference and deployment phases. I will also discuss our recent advances and future opportunities in these researches.</p>
